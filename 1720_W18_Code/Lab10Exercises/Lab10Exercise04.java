/**
 * This app determines all the font names installed on the system. It determines
 * the number of font names that begin with each letter of the alphabet. Then it
 * prints two tab-delimited tokens to the console: the first token is the letter
 * of the alphabet, the second token is the number of font names with names that
 * start with that letter.
 * 
 * If a given letter of the alphabet doesn't have any font names, then the app
 * doesn't necessarily print out that letter (with the second token of 0).
